name: Build and push Docker image

# This workflow builds the Docker image defined in the repository and pushes it
# to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) whenever changes are pushed to the main
# branch or when manually triggered.  GHCR uses the same namespace as your
# repository, so if your repo is ``github.com/OWNER/REPO`` then the image will
# be published as ``ghcr.io/OWNER/REPO``.  The workflow uses the
# ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` for authentication to GHCR; GitHub automatically
# provisions this token with write permissions to packages when the workflow
# includes the appropriate ``packages: write`` permission.
